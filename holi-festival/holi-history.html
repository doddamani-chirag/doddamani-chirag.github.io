                <h1>History Of Holi</h1>

                <blockquote>The origin of Holi is believed to be before the birth of Christ. Legend goes that Lord Vishnu had assassinated the younger 
                    brother of the demon lord, Hiranyakashipu. Apart from avenging his brother's death, the demon king had the ulterior motive of ruling the
                     heaven, the earth, and the underworld by defeating Vishnu.</blockquote>
                     <p>Long before water balloons and pichkaaris, Holi was only an idea- an idea that transpired to become one of the most amusing festivals of the world. Yes, Holi is the festival of colours. But what does colour symbolize here? We are never certain. But we always hope that colouring something gives life to it. And thereby, perhaps Holi is the celebration of life itself. Holi accolades life, love, its vitality, its passion. <br>
                        There are stories that date back the origin of Holi and recounts tales in mythology that trace the advent of our attempt at painting the human race more colourful. Maybe they are true, maybe they aren’t. But the essence of colour compels us to shun our logical minds in the hope of a dreamy world full of rainbows. <br>
                        One of the most ancient festivals of India, Holi was also known as “Holika”. Since time immemorial, the festival finds colour in numerous scriptures, such as in works like Jaimini's Purvamimamsa-Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras with even detailed descriptions in ancient texts like the Narad Purana and Bhavishyad Purana. The festival of “holikotsav” was also mentioned in the 7th century work, Ratnavali, by King Harsha. <br>
                        Also known as “Dol Purnima” and “Bashanta Utsav”, Holi itself is manoeuvred into several colours establishing its sense literally into our mind and soul through centuries. <br>
