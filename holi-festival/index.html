        <p>Holi, the festival of colours, has a lot of meaning for individuals. It is the triumph of good over evil, and it is a day to forget about our problems and make peace with everyone. People of all castes, creeds, and races get together on this day to enjoy the holiday with their loved ones and neighbours without prejudice. The event is held on the Purnima (full moon day) of Phalgun, a Hindu calendar month. This celebration is significant for people since it marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring.</p>
